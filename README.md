# Pyber


Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

The purpose of this analysis is to review the PyBer rides data to have a better understanding of the ridership and fare metrics (Urban vs Rurel).

## Results:

Ride Sharing Data by City Type Summary

Analysis identified that urban ride sharing represents highest (62.7%) of all fares generated, key reason for this large percentage is volume of riders and more drivers in urban centers. The average fare per ride in Urban centres is $24.53 which is 29.2% ($10.09) lower than that of Rural and 20.8% ($6.44) than that of Suburban fares. Reason for this is due to high frequency of rides within short distance which generate more min fare and less accumulated distance.
